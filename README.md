# Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains my solution for the Titanic Survival Prediction challenge on Kaggle. In this project, I used data science and machine learning techniques to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not.


## Problem Statement

The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting the survival of passengers based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset

I used the famous Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Approach

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed EDA to gain insights into the data and visualize patterns.

2. Feature Engineering: I created new features and selected relevant features for model training.

3. Data Preprocessing: I cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

4. Model Building: I experimented with different machine learning algorithms and selected the best-performing model.

5. Model Evaluation: I evaluated the model using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation.

6. Submission: Finally, I made predictions on the test dataset and submitted the results to Kaggle.

## Results

My model achieved an accuracy of 79% on the test dataset, placing it 674 in the leaderboard.
